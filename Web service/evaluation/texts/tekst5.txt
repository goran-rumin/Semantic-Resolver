The head of a key US congressional investigation into alleged Russian hacking has temporarily stepped down amid an ethics inquiry into him. 
House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes is now himself under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. 
The panel is looking into claims that the Republican disclosed classified intelligence. 
Mr Nunes called the charges "entirely false" and "politically motivated". 
He said his decision to step aside came after "several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics". 
Mr Nunes added he would continue to fulfil his other responsibilities as chairman, requesting to speak to the ethics panel "in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims". 
The House Ethics Committee said in a statement on Thursday: "The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Devin Nunes may have made unauthorised disclosures of classified information, in violation of House rules, laws, regulations, or other standards of conduct." 
Watchdog groups Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington had asked the House ethics panel to investigate Mr Nunes. 
His political foes have accused him of helping the White House to divert attention from several investigations into links between the Trump team and Russian officials. 
Mr Nunes has acknowledged making an after-dark trip to the White House grounds last month that even the congressman's own aides were apparently unaware of. 
The next day at a hastily arranged news conference he announced he had learned that post-election communications of Mr Trump's team had been monitored by US intelligence agencies as they snooped on foreign officials. 
He expressed alarm that information about the then-incoming president's aides had been swept up in US intelligence reports. 
Mr Nunes' Democratic colleagues on the panel were furious that he had not shared such information with them before going public.
