Turkey's top electoral board has overwhelmingly rejected objections to the way the country's referendum was run, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported Wednesday. 
A narrow majority of voters in Sunday's referendum backed the 18-article constitutional reform package, which will transform the country's parliamentary system into a powerful executive presidency. 
But the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), along with individuals and civil society groups, challenged the result -- amid concerns over unstamped ballots in particular -- and called for it to be annulled. 
After considering their complaints Wednesday, the electoral body ruled by 10 to one to deny the objections put forward by the CHP and hundreds of individuals, Anadolu said. 
The reform plan, put forward by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), will give Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sweeping and largely unchecked powers. 
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking on CNN Turk, urged the opposition Wednesday to drop its challenge. 
"Objection to election results should remain there," he said. "The opposition should not call people to take to the streets and say they do not recognize election results." 
But Bulent Tezcan, deputy chairman of the CHP, told reporters Monday that the party would appeal to the European Court of Human Rights if the electoral body didn't void Sunday's referendum result. 
"The only decision that will end the legitimacy debate and ease people's concerns about the judiciary is for the High Election Board to cancel the referendum," Tezcan said. 
Demonstrators have taken to the streets, including in Istanbul, to protest the referendum's outcome. 
Prominent political activist Abdurrahman Atalay was detained Wednesday along with 16 other people, according to Zeynep Atalay, his cousin and one of his lawyers.
