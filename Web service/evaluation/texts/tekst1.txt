The statement from Republican Senator Richard Burr, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, dismissed Donald Trump's claim his phones were tapped. 
Mr Trump had accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the presidential race. 
But White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Mr Trump maintains his claims. 
"He stands by it," Mr Spicer said at a daily news briefing on Thursday. 
The press secretary also refused to accept the Senate Intelligence Committee report, saying "they're not findings". 
Mr Burr joins a cadre of Republican lawmakers who have rejected the allegation.
