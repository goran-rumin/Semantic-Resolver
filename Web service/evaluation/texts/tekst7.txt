A few short years ago, Aaron Hernandez was destined to be a football superstar and was already one of the NFL's most promising tight ends. 
On Wednesday morning, the man who seemed to have everything hanged himself in a jail cell where he was serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of his friend Odin Lloyd. 
Hernandez's death came just a week after he was acquitted of separate double murder charges stemming from a drive-by shooting in 2012. 
Friends and fans alike have wondered for a long time now: How could a Super Bowl star for one of the league's top franchises fall so far into a life of killing and deceit? 
Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. 
"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol," Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. 
The young Hernandez was the "golden boy," playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. 
Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends.
