Ambulance crews were treating people on Westminster Bridge and on the road down to Parliament Square after a car hit pedestrians, killing two people. 
They treated several people who were hit by the car, before it was driven into the railings of Parliament. 
"This was a day we've planned for but hoped would never happen," said the Met Police's Head of Counter Terrorism Mark Rowley as he gave an update on the incident. 
Patrol boats were out on the Thames. A woman was pulled from the river and treated for injuries after she apparently jumped in. 
People have been told to avoid Parliament Square, Whitehall, Lambeth Bridge, Victoria Street to the junction of Broadway, and the Embankment between Westminster and Embankment Tube.
